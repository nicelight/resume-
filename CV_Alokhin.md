### Profile

Electronics engineer and DIY-maker. I enjoy seeing an idea slowly turn into a working reality through a beautiful process of exploration. My working areas: Arduino IoT projects, soldered PCB, firmware up and running — all with human-friendly docs and clear how-to guides, 3D-printed spare parts. I enjoy breaking down complex things into simple words :) In the last couple of years I’ve been building IoT projects on ESP32/Arduino, making smart devices for home and farming, and mentoring people into engineering, mostly through online communities. I love learning new things so much!

**Top-5 skills:**

1. IoT with ESP32 (Arduino, ESPHome, MQTT, Telegram bots, web interfaces)
2. Custom web servers/panels (FastAPI/Node.js)
3. Python (scripts, bots, backend services)
4. Mentoring and one-on-one teaching
5. Advanced use of AI to boost productivity and level up engineering skills

### Key Achievements (2023–2025)

* **Game Showroom** — light & sound automation for corporate games; operator console, effect scenarios, remote control.

* **Hydroponics Smart-Box** — nutrient solution control, humidity/ventilation, smart lighting (sunset/sunrise). The setup consistently yielded sweet peas.

* **AI Photo Processing Server** — web panel and pipelines: background replacement, face-swap, style-transfer; task queue and basic moderation.

* **Access Control System** — QR bracelets + camera, verification in an account system, and turnstile control. Stack: Node.js, ESP32, Ethernet, QR scanning.

* **Interactive “Cars” Attraction** — Wi-Fi control of carts; speed tied to exercise-bike pedals; multiplayer mode.

* **Smart-home sensor line** — T/RH/pressure/CO₂ → home-automation server; dashboards in Home Assistant.

* **Home Assistant** — deployment and setup of a smart-home server, automations, dashboards.

* **Offline Voice Assistant** — Whisper server + ESP32 “satellite” with a digital microphone.

* **Agrivoltaics installation** — semi-shading solar panels for a raspberry field; installation and commissioning.

* **3D Printing** — DIY 3D printer assembly and calibration; printing enclosures and parts.


### Programs & Teaching

* **Teaching experience:** instructor at the private programming school **Coddy** (left due to unpaid promised compensation). I run individual courses (mostly online) and in-person workshops.

* **Workshops delivered multiple times:** basics of robotics; Python bot programming; introduction to website creation; “AI tools for engineers”.

* **One-on-one tutoring topics:** embedded development on Arduino-based boards; building smart-home systems; the programmer’s path from zero to junior full-stack.

* **Community consulting:** I actively help in online communities, mainly Telegram groups. I also run a YouTube channel.

* **Audience:** school and university students; sometimes adults 20–35.

* **Communities & media:**  
I own niche Telegram communities where I actively consult on electronics and programming. I also publish lessons on YouTube.
  * YouTube channel ~0.77k subscribers
